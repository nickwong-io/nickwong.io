                The second iteration of Nalukai was completely different than the first. Through the implementation of a meticulous schedule, a 10x increase of guest speakers, and new learning environment, Nalukai 2.0 was, in my opinion, a large leap in an amazing direction. The 10-day camp was packed with a schedule that encompassed work “sprints”, interactive lectures, guest-speakers, and allocated time for the personal well-being of the campers. Speakers and guests from venture capital firms, tech-company powerhouses like Facebook and Twitch.tv, and educational institutions like Stanford created a powerful network that campers could tap into. On top of the changes in the curriculum, to be able to work out of Hawaiʻi Preparatory Academy's Energy Lab only contributed to the electrifying nuances of innovation, education, and entrepreneurship.

                In the spring of my junior year, and after a few meetings with Kamehameha Schools’ administration, I was given the opportunity to travel to San Francisco. For a while then, especially after Nalukai, I wanted to travel to the Bay Area to experience the zeitgeist of the tech capital of the world. During my spring break I, along with my mom, Pakalani Bello from Kamehameha Schools’ Communications, and Ken Chong from ReVisualEyeZ media toured headquarters of some of the world’s most famous technology companies. Utilizing my professional network at home, and my growing network in the Bay, I setup meetings with venture capitalists, developers at companies like Google and eBay, and even Kamehameha alumni in the tech industry. The week-long expedition filled with tours, college-visits, and meetings solidified my love for the area, and opened many doors for further opportunity.

              <p class="desc">The start of a new semester marks a time where my Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter feeds are filled with countless screenshots of my classmate’s schedules.  KSCTool removes the need for these posts cluttering my social media feeds. Through KSCTool, classmates are able to log on via their school KSConnect accounts (student info) and instantly receive lists filled with other students that share the same class.</p>
